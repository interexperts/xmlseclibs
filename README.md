# xmlseclibs

This is a fork of robrichards/xmlseclibs @
https://code.google.com/p/xmlseclibs/

The main difference between the library by Rob Richards and this library is
that the namespace identifier (`ds:`) is removed from the `<Signature>` tags,
because this caused problems in some applications.
